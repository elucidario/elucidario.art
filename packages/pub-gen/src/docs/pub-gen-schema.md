# `pub-gen-schema.json`

It's the main schema of a publication created by pub-gen. Describes the data structure of the document being generated, extends the [data-package.json](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/data-package/), so it has all its properties and adds some specific to pub-gen.

{{json-schema:pub-gen-schema.json}}
