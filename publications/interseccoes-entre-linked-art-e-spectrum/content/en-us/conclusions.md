# Conclusions

Mdorim is a data model designed for use in the Elucidário.art plugin, currently in development and scheduled for release by the end of this year. The model was created to be flexible and allow for the representation and description of Art Collections belonging to Museums. It was developed based on two standards: Linked Art and Spectrum. Linked Art was chosen as a standard for describing cultural heritage and is responsible for describing the main entities within Mdorim. Spectrum was selected for its procedures used to represent the workflows of Elucidário.art.

Thank you!
