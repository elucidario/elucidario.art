# Introduction

Hello everyone, first of all, I would like to thank the organizers of this enriching event and the opportunity to exchange experiences with others colleagues in the field.

My name is Henrique Godinho, and I work as the communication coordinator at The Ema Klabin House Museum in São Paulo, a collector's museum with over 1700 items in its museum collection, spanning 35 centuries of art history. I am also a professional master's student in Information Management, specializing in the Organization, Mediation, and Circulation of Information within the Graduate Program in Information Science at the School of Communications and Arts at the University of São Paulo.

I am here to present a bit of my research in the master's program, which involves the development of a WordPress plugin as a Collection Management System: The Elucidário.art plugin.
