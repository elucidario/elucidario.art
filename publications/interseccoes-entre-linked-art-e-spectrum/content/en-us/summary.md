# Summary

<!-- versao 3 aprovada -->
In this article, we present the Data Model for the Organization and Representation of Museological Information (MDORIM) of Elucidário.art, an app under development that aims to be a tool for the management and dissemination of museum collections. MDORIM uses Linked-art for information representation and the Standard Procedures for Collections Recording Used in Museums (SPECTRUM) version 5.1. The life cycle of a museum object can describe its trajectory from before its acquisition to leaving the collection, including stages of conservation, restoration, exhibition, research, loans, among others. SPECTRUM is a standard that describes 21 procedures for managing museum collections, nine of which are mandatory for a museum to be accredited by the Collections Trust, a British organization that defines museum management standards. SPECTRUM is also recommended by ICOM and used by museums around the world, including in Brazil. Linked-Art is a data model for applications based on CIDOC-CRM. Focused on data representation for art museums, Linked-Art was created by an international CIDOC working group and representatives from museum institutions. MDORIM establishes a bridge between Linked-Art and SPECTRUM, allowing documentation management to be interoperable using common standards among museums. To achieve this, we will analyze the documentation of SPECTRUM and Linked-Art to create a mapping between the two. MDORIM also introduces information classes for auditing and control, such as editing history and permission levels by user type.

<!-- The life-cycle of a museum object can describe its trajectory before its acquisition to its exit from the collection, passing through stages of conservation, restoration, exhibition, research, loans, among others. Elucidário.art's Data Model for Organization and Representation of Museum Information (MDORIM) uses Linked-art to represent this information and implements the Standard Procedures for Collections Recording Used in Museums (SPECTRUM) in version 5.1, which describes 21 procedures for museum collections, with 9 of them being main and mandatory for accreditation by Collections Trust, a British organization that sets standards for museum management. SPECTRUM is also recommended by International Council of Museums (ICOM) and used by museums worldwide, including in Brazil. Linked-Art is a data model for applications based on CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model and is focused on  representing data for art museums. Linked-Art was created by an international CIDOC working group and representatives of museum institutions. MDORIM seeks to establish a bridge between Linked-Art and SPECTRUM, allowing the management of documentation in an interoperable way using a common standard among museums. To do so, we will analyze the documentations of SPECTRUM and Linked-art and create a mapping between the two. Additionally, MDORIM introduces information classes for auditing, such as editing history and permission levels by user type. The Elucidário.art app is being developed as part of the Professional Master's Program in Information Management by the Post-Graduate Program in Information Science at the School of Communication and Arts of the University of São Paulo (PPGCI-ECA-USP). -->
