The museological object life-cicle may describe its trajectory from its acquisition to its exit from the collection, passing through all the conservation, restoration, exhibition, research, loans, etc. stages. The *Modelo de Dados para Organização e Representação da Informação Museológica* (MDORIM) of Elucidário.art uses Linked-art to represent this information and implements the *Standard Procedures for Collections Recording Used in Museums* (SPECTRUM) version 5.1 that describes 21 procedures for museum collections management, being 9 of them main and mandatory for the accreditation of a museum to *Collections Trust*. Although this standard is mandatory for the museums of the United Kingdom, it is recommended by the *International Council of Museums* (ICOM) and used by museums around the world, including in Brazil. Linked-Art is a data model for applications based on the CIDOC *Conceptual Reference Model* and is focused on data representation for art museums. Linked-Art was created by an international working group of CIDOC and representatives of museological institutions such as The Frick Collection, J. Paul Getty Trust, Rijksmuseum, Louvre, and others. MDORIM seeks to establish a bridge between Linked-Art and SPECTRUM, allowing the representation of museological documentation in an interoperable way and using a common standard among museums around the world. For this, we will analyze the detailed documentation of SPECTRUM and Linked-art and create a mapping between the two, in addition, MDORIM also presents a model for auditing the information, maintaining the control of the history of information editions registered.
